# FF_Breakout_WRs

All data relating to fantasy points is in ppr (or points per reception). This project was to try to find what makes quarterbacks "starter-worthy" (over 18.4 points per game) in fantasy football. (Work in progress)

Analyzing_Breakout_WRs has nothing to do with this project and I can't figure out how to delete it.
